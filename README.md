# üîê Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

My C implementations of the Cryptopals cryptography challenges. This project is about learning how real cryptographic systems work by building everything from the ground up ‚Äî no crypto libraries, no shortcuts, just raw bytes and bitwise operations.

‚û°Ô∏è Based on the challenges at [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com/)
